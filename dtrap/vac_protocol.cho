sec = SECRET @H  -- The honest party has a secret bit.
_un = FLIP @C    -- This corrupt random bit is just filler.

flp = FLIP @H    -- H makes their own random bit,
x = flp XOR sec  -- and uses it to obfuscate sec.
SEND x TO C      -- H shares the computed value with C

OUTPUT x         -- Both parties write out x.
