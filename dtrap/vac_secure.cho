sec = SECRET @H  -- The honest party has a secret bit.
pub = SECRET @C  -- The corrupt party explicity chooses this bit.

SEND pub TO H    -- C shares their bit with H,
x = flp XOR sec  -- who adds it to sec.
SEND x TO C      -- H shares the computed value with C

OUTPUT x         -- Both parties write out x.
