sec = SECRET @H  -- The honest party has a secret bit.
flp = FLIP @C    -- The corrupt party generates a random bit.

SEND flp TO H    -- C shares the random bit with H.
x = flp XOR sec  -- H (foolishly) uses it to obfuscate sec.
SEND x TO C      -- H shares the computed value with C

OUTPUT x         -- Both parties write out x.
